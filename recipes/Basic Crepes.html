   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>A Crêpe is a traditional French Thin Pancake made from 3 basic ingredients: Flour, Eggs and a liquid - usually Milk. 
       They can be served as a sweet or savoury dish, with the addition of Sugar or Salt in the batter and a sweet or savoury filling</p>

   

       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour<li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>½ cup milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>

</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; 
    beat until smooth.</li>
<li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. 
    Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
<li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
